1. Install BackUpWordPress either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Sit back and relax safe in the knowledge that your whole site will be backed up every day.

The plugin will try to use the `mysqldump` and `zip` commands via shell if they are available, using these will greatly improve the time it takes to back up your site.
